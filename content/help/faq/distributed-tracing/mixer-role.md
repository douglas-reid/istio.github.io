title: What role does Mixer play in the Istio tracing story?

By default, Mixer participates in tracing by generating its own spans for requests that are already selected for tracing by Envoy proxies. This enables operators to observe the participation of the mixer-based policy enforcement mechanisms within the mesh. If the `istio-policy` configuration is disabled mesh-wide, Mixer does not participate in tracing in this way.

Mixer can also be used to generate trace spans for data plane traffic. Mixerâ€™s Stackdriver adapter is the first adapter to support this capability. Soon, we will support Zipkin (and Zipkin API compatible backends) in a similar fashion.

For Mixer-generated traces, Istio still relies on Envoy to generate trace context and to forward it to the applications that must propagate the context. Instead of Envoy itself sending trace information to a tracing backend, Mixer will distill client and server spans from the regular Envoy reporting for each request based on the operator-supplied configuration. In this way, operators can precisely control when and how trace data is generated and perhaps remove certain services entirely from a trace or provide more detailed information for certain namespaces.
